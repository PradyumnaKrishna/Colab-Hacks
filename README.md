### Colab Threatens to Ban, Why?

**Recent changes in Colaboratory T&C prohibits the following actions and could result in ban from colab[^1].**

- file hosting, media serving, or other web service offerings not related to interactive compute with Colab
- downloading torrents or engaging in peer-to-peer file-sharing
- using a remote desktop or SSH
- connecting to remote proxies
- mining cryptocurrency
- running denial-of-service attacks
- password cracking
- using multiple accounts to work around access or resource usage restrictions

The changes are made because resources in Colab are prioritized for interactive use cases.

This means all the notebooks present in this repository are prohibited and use with your own risk. To discuss, follow up on issue [#91](https://github.com/PradyumnaKrishna/Colab-Hacks/issues/91).
